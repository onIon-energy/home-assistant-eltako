# How to detect Switch Signals and react on thoese in Home Assistant

This example is about how to trigger complex automations defined in home assistant which can be triggered by wall-mounted switches.

First of all you need to register your swicht into the home assistant configuration ``/config/configuration.yaml``. Those switches are declared as binary sensors and their eep is "F6-02-01". You can find the identifiers of your switches on a sticker at the back.

<div style="border: 2px dotted darkgrey; padding: 12px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom: 20px; ">
üìù <b>Note:</b> <br />
You can <b>enable debug logs</b> to easily test which switch was pressed. Therefore I've installed the addon <a href="https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-log-viewer">log-viewer</a> and extended the home assistant config with:
<code><pre>
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    eltako: debug
</pre></code>
<b>To modify the Home Assistant configuration</b> I use <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/configurator">File Editor</a>. After doing changes don't forget to restart Home Assistant what you can easily do in the menu of File Editor.

</div>

See example snipped to declare your switch:
```
  binary_sensor:
    - id: "FE-DB-DA-04"  # taster 1
      eep: "F6-02-01"
    - id: "FE-DB-B6-40"  # taster 2
      eep: "F6-02-01"
```

After you have registered the switch in Home Assistant configuration and after you have restarted Home Assistant you can see messages in the logger view.

To create an automation go in Home Assistant to ``Settings > Automation & Scenes > Create Automation``.
As trigger choose ``Event`` and enter ``eltako_button_pressed_`` followed by your switch id in one word without spaces. Now any button on your switch will be detected. You can filter for specific buttons or button combinations on your switch by using conditions. To do so you need a ``template condition`` which is unfortunatley not available in the webUI, therefore just switch to yaml mode. 

In my example below the auotmation is listening on switch. There is one condition which filters out the upper left button. Only then the action is triggered. the action itself is a simple relai which is switched either on or off.:
```
alias: Eltako Taser Test
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: eltako_button_pressed_FE-DB-DA-04
condition:
  - condition: template
    value_template: >-
      {{ 'LT' in trigger.event.data.pressed_buttons and not
      trigger.event.data.two_buttons_pressed }}
action:
  - type: toggle
    device_id: fe25388ed8dcd06b38ca2efd736cdc0c
    entity_id: light.eltako_00000001
    domain: light
    enabled: true
mode: single
```
After saving the automation and by pusshing the swich you can see a popup when the automation recognizes the event triggered by the switch.

This action only works if you have previously registered the light/relay in the Home Assistant configuration. 
Below you can find the whole configuration of Home Assistant for this example:
```
# Loads default set of integrations. Do not remove.
default_config:

# Load frontend themes from the themes folder
frontend:
  themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes

# Text to speech
tts:
  - platform: google_translate

automation: !include automations.yaml
script: !include scripts.yaml
scene: !include scenes.yaml

eltako:
  light:
    - id: "00-00-00-01"
      name: "Relay Test"
      eep: "M5-38-08"
      sender:
          id: "00-00-B1-01"
          eep: "A5-38-08"
  binary_sensor:
    - id: "FE-DB-DA-04"  # taster 1
      eep: "F6-02-01"
    - id: "FE-DB-B6-40"  # taster 2
      eep: "F6-02-01"
      
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    eltako: debug
```

In this example the sender id ``00-00-B1-01`` for the light must be registered in the corresponding relay e.g. via [Eltako Software PCT14](https://www.eltako.com/en/software-pct14/). Don't forget to choose function type ``51`` for software controlled command.

Code for detecting the switch and firing the event can be found in function ``value_changed`` in [binary_sensor.py](/eltako/binary_sensor.py).
