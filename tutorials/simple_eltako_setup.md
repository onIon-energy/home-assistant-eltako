# Installation Example
## Hardware
In this setup I've used:
* Eltako FSTN14-12V/12W (power supply)
* Eltako FAM14 (BA=2 or 4, Auto=1)
* Eltako FGW14-USB (BA=6, USB connected to PC)
* Eltako FSR14-4x (Relay, output 1 connected to light bulb)
* Eltako double rocker switch

**Hint**: 
* operation mode of FAM14: BA=2 works fine for development BA=4 let's defined list of actors send their status frequently so that receivers which are out of sync get their status permanently.

**to be continued**
